# E-Commerce-Dashboard-main
Developed an E-commerce dashboard, including registration and 
login with different user types and an authentication system.
• Created a backend with Nodejs and Express.js to make an API for 
login, registration, update product, list product, add product and 
connect with frontend using pre-built JavaScript fetch API.
• Utilized mongodB for the database management system.
• Also, implemented token verification for securing user data and 
authorization using jsonwebtoken(jwt) for our application.
